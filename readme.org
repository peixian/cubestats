* cubestats
Small (flask? tornado? python scripts slapped together without concern for memory safety?) application to parse and analyze mtg cubes.

** Dependencies: 
You'll need all of the following + all of the dependicies these packages require
- Usual anaconda stuff (pandas, numpy (*probably should be linked to BLAS*), scipy) 
- Google api python client
- Maybe NLTK/Gensim/FastText later for parsing of mechanics

** Credientials:
- To use google sheets with this you'll need some credientials: https://developers.google.com/sheets/quickstart/python
